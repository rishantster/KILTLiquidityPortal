# KILT Liquidity Incentive Portal

## Overview
The KILT Liquidity Incentive Portal is a production-ready DeFi application for managing concentrated liquidity positions in the KILT/ETH Uniswap V3 pool on the Base network. It enables users to earn dynamic rewards from the KILT treasury through a zero-restriction claiming system. The project provides a full-stack TypeScript application with React frontend and Express.js backend, focusing on real-time blockchain data, signature-based security, and mobile-optimized user experience. The business vision is to provide a seamless and secure platform for users to participate in KILT liquidity incentives, expanding KILT's presence in the DeFi ecosystem and attracting more liquidity to the token.

## Critical Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Code Changes Not Reflected in Browser (Server Routing Configuration)
**Date Resolved**: August 8, 2025  
**Severity**: Critical - Development workflow completely broken  

**Problem**:
- Code changes (CSS, components, styling) were not being reflected in the browser
- Multiple styling approaches failed (Tailwind classes, inline styles, JavaScript-based responsive design)
- User frustration after multiple failed attempts to fix header styling

**Root Cause**:
Server routing configuration in `server/index.ts` was prioritizing production builds from `dist/public` directory, but the production build was missing or outdated. This created a conflict where:
1. Server tried to serve static files from non-existent/stale `dist/public`
2. Vite development server hot-reloading wasn't working properly
3. Browser received cached/old content instead of new changes

**Solution**:
```bash
npm run build  # Create production assets in dist/public
# Restart the application workflow
```

**Prevention/Detection**:
- If code changes aren't reflecting, check if `dist/public` directory exists and is recent
- Verify server console for routing errors or file-not-found messages
- Run production build when development server seems "stuck"
- Monitor for symptoms: styling changes ignored, component updates not visible, hot reload not working

**Files Involved**:
- `server/index.ts` - Server routing logic
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
- `dist/public/` - Production build output directory

**Technical Details**:
The Express server routes static content by checking for production builds first (lines 223-259 in `server/index.ts`). When these files don't exist or are stale, the fallback to development server can malfunction, breaking the entire development workflow.

**Impact**: Complete development workflow disruption - no code changes visible until resolved.
