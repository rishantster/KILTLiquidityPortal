# üîÑ Hybrid Reward System: Best of Both Worlds

## Overview
The KILT Hybrid Reward System combines Merkl's proven fee-based approach with KILT's time-based commitment model, creating the most comprehensive concentrated liquidity incentive mechanism available.

## üéØ The Hybrid Formula

```
R_u = [merklRatio √ó (w_fees√óF_u/F_T + w_token0√óT0_u/T0_T + w_token1√óT1_u/T1_T) + 
       (1-merklRatio) √ó (w_liquidity√óL_u/L_T + w_time√óD_u/P)] √ó R √ó IRM √ó CB
```

### Components Breakdown

#### **Merkl Components (60% of rewards)**
- **Fee Earnings (30%)**: Rewards based on actual fees earned by the position
- **KILT Holdings (15%)**: Rewards based on KILT token holdings during swaps
- **ETH Holdings (15%)**: Rewards based on ETH token holdings during swaps

#### **KILT Components (40% of rewards)**
- **Liquidity Share (25%)**: Rewards based on position's share of total liquidity
- **Time Progression (15%)**: Rewards based on position duration and commitment

#### **Multipliers**
- **IRM (In-Range Multiplier)**: 1.0 for in-range positions, 0.0 for out-of-range
- **CB (Concentration Bonus)**: 1.0x to 2.0x bonus for tighter ranges

## üîÄ Adaptive Reward Distribution

### **Early Pool Stage (Low Activity)**
- **Merkl Components**: Lower weight due to minimal fee generation
- **KILT Components**: Higher weight to incentivize initial liquidity
- **Result**: Rewards early adopters for taking initial risk

### **Mature Pool Stage (High Activity)**
- **Merkl Components**: Higher weight due to substantial fee generation
- **KILT Components**: Lower weight as liquidity stabilizes
- **Result**: Rewards active traders and efficient liquidity providers
