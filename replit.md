# KILT Liquidity Incentive Portal

## Overview

This is a comprehensive decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity provisioning portal for the KILT token on the Base network. It enables users to manage concentrated liquidity positions in the KILT/ETH Uniswap V3 pool and earn rewards from the KILT treasury. The system is designed as a full-stack TypeScript application with a React frontend and Express.js backend, featuring real-time data integration, advanced analytics, and mobile-first responsive design. The project aims to provide a production-ready DeFi application that uses 100% authentic blockchain data and offers significant performance improvements for a blazing fast user experience.

- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Web3 Integration**: Viem for type-safe Ethereum interactions on Base network
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with mobile wallet deep link integration.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Incorporates a "Cluely.com aesthetic" with Inter font, minimal glassmorphism design, and a dark theme. Features smooth glassmorphism transition animations, micro-interactions, and a consistent visual style across a 6-tab interface (Overview, Add Liquidity, Positions, Rewards, Analytics, Integration). Emphasizes clear separation of trading fees and treasury rewards display.

**Backend Stack**:
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript and ESM modules
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (using Neon Database for serverless deployment)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with Zod validation and JSON responses.
- **Real-time Data**: CoinGecko API integration for live KILT token data.
- **Performance**: Features aggressive caching, parallel processing (e.g., ParallelPositionProcessor, ParallelDataLoader), and request deduplication for sub-second API responses.

**Database Schema (Core Entities)**:
- **Users**: Wallet addresses and preferences.
- **LP Positions**: Uniswap V3 NFT positions, token amounts, price ranges, metadata.
- **Rewards**: KILT treasury reward tracking (synced with smart contract).
- **Pool Stats**: Real-time pool metrics (TVL, volume, APR, current price).
- **Analytics Tables**: Position snapshots, performance metrics, fee events.

**Smart Contract Architecture**:
- **Core Contract**: `MultiTokenTreasuryPool` for advanced treasury-based reward distribution.
- **Token**: KILT (0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8) on Base network.
- **Multi-Token Support**: Designed to support KILT, BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOT, or any ERC20 token as rewards.
- **Security**: Funds held directly by contract (no external wallet private keys), includes ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, Ownable, SafeERC20 protections.

- **Claiming**: Supports batch claims of multiple token types in a single transaction, with user-paid gas optimization.
- **Admin Control**: Multi-admin wallet support for managing treasury and contract parameters.
- **Reward Formula**: Sophisticated formula (e.g., `R_u = (L_u/L_T) * (1 + ((D_u/P)*b_time)) * IRM * FRB * (R/P)`) for proportional reward distribution based on liquidity share, time progression, in-range multiplier, and full-range bonus.

**Core Functionality Specifications**:
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect (with deep link support for mobile wallets like Trust Wallet, Rainbow).
- **Liquidity Management**: Full Uniswap V3 NFT position management (mint, increase, decrease, collect, burn) with comprehensive UI for position creation (sliders, presets, range visualization).
