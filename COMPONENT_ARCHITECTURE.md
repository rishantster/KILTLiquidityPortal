# KILT Liquidity Portal - Component Architecture

## Overview
The KILT Liquidity Portal has been reorganized into a clean, tabbed interface structure that provides better navigation and user experience while maintaining all core functionality.

## Main Architecture

### 🏠 MainDashboard (`client/src/components/main-dashboard.tsx`)
The central hub component that organizes all features into a cohesive tabbed interface.

**Features:**
- Wallet connection check and routing
- Responsive 6-tab navigation
- Real-time KILT price and market data display
- Clean overview dashboard with key metrics

**Tabs:**
1. **Overview** - Quick stats, welcome message, key metrics
2. **Liquidity** - Liquidity provision interface
3. **Positions** - User position management
4. **Rewards** - Reward tracking and claiming
5. **Analytics** - Advanced performance analytics
6. **Integration** - Technical Uniswap V3 features

### 🔌 Core Components

#### 📊 Analytics System
- **AnalyticsDashboard** - Comprehensive analytics with charts
- **use-analytics** - React hooks for data fetching
- **server/analytics.ts** - Backend analytics service
- **Database Tables:** 5 new tables for position tracking, performance metrics, and historical data

#### 💧 Liquidity Management
- **LiquidityProvision** - Primary liquidity addition interface
- **UserPositions** - Position tracking and management
- **RewardsTracking** - Reward calculation and claiming

#### 🔗 Blockchain Integration
- **IntegrationDashboard** - Real Uniswap V3 contract integration
- **WalletConnect** - Base network wallet connectivity
- **use-uniswap-v3** - Uniswap V3 interaction hooks

## Data Flow

### 🔄 Frontend Data Flow
1. **MainDashboard** checks wallet connection
2. **Tabs** organize features by function
3. **Hooks** manage data fetching and state
4. **Components** render UI with real-time updates

### 🗄️ Backend Data Flow
1. **API Routes** handle requests (`server/routes.ts`)
2. **Analytics Service** processes complex calculations (`server/analytics.ts`)
3. **Storage Layer** manages data persistence (`server/storage.ts`)
4. **Database Schema** stores structured data (`shared/schema.ts`)

## Key Features Implemented
