# KILT Liquidity Incentive Portal

## Overview

This is a comprehensive decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity provisioning portal for the KILT token on the Base network. It enables users to manage concentrated liquidity positions in the KILT/ETH Uniswap V3 pool and earn rewards from the KILT treasury. The system is designed as a full-stack TypeScript application with a React frontend and Express.js backend, featuring real-time data integration, advanced analytics, and mobile-first responsive design. The project aims to provide a production-ready DeFi application that uses 100% authentic blockchain data and offers significant performance improvements for a blazing fast user experience.

- **Analytics Tables**: Position snapshots, performance metrics, fee events.

**Smart Contract Architecture**:
- **Core Contract**: `MultiTokenTreasuryPool` for advanced treasury-based reward distribution.
- **Token**: KILT (0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8) on Base network.
- **Multi-Token Support**: Designed to support KILT, BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOT, or any ERC20 token as rewards.
- **Security**: Funds held directly by contract (no external wallet private keys), includes ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, Ownable, SafeERC20 protections.
- **Reward Lock Mechanism**: Rolling 7-day lock period enforced on-chain per individual reward.
- **Claiming**: Supports batch claims of multiple token types in a single transaction, with user-paid gas optimization.
- **Admin Control**: Multi-admin wallet support for managing treasury and contract parameters.
- **Reward Formula**: Sophisticated formula (e.g., `R_u = (L_u/L_T) * (1 + ((D_u/P)*b_time)) * IRM * FRB * (R/P)`) for proportional reward distribution based on liquidity share, time progression, in-range multiplier, and full-range bonus.

**Core Functionality Specifications**:
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect (with deep link support for mobile wallets like Trust Wallet, Rainbow).
- **Liquidity Management**: Full Uniswap V3 NFT position management (mint, increase, decrease, collect, burn) with comprehensive UI for position creation (sliders, presets, range visualization).
- **Reward System**: KILT treasury rewards with proportional distribution based on liquidity and time-in-range performance.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live KILT token data, pool metrics (TVL, volume, APR), and user portfolio dashboards.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design, mobile-optimized tabs, deep link integration for wallet connections.
- **Position Tracking**: Complete LP position lifecycle management with historical analytics.
- **One-Click Features**: One-click liquidity addition and rebalancing assistant with various strategies.
