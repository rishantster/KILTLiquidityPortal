# KILT Liquidity Incentive Portal

## Overview
The KILT Liquidity Incentive Portal is a production-ready DeFi application for managing concentrated liquidity positions in the KILT/ETH Uniswap V3 pool on the Base network. It enables users to earn dynamic rewards from the KILT treasury through a zero-restriction claiming system. The project provides a full-stack TypeScript application with React frontend and Express.js backend, focusing on real-time blockchain data, signature-based security, and mobile-optimized user experience.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)
- **Smart Contract**: DynamicTreasuryPool deployed with zero claiming restrictions and signature-based security
- **Architecture**: Eliminated batch processing, rate limiting, and claim caps for unlimited individual claiming
- **Security**: Implemented cryptographic signature validation with 1-hour replay protection windows
- **Documentation**: Organized project structure with comprehensive docs in `/docs/` folder
- **File Structure**: Cleaned and organized development artifacts into proper folders

## User Preferences
**Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language without technical jargon
**Design Inspiration**: Cluely.com aesthetic with Inter font and minimal glassmorphism design
**Data Priority**: Zero fallbacks - only authentic real-time blockchain data from verified sources
**Mobile Experience**: Optimized wallet connection with WalletConnect, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet support
**Gas Estimation**: Real Base network costs only (currently $0.02 total transaction costs)
**Suggested Domain**: liq.kilt.io (for liquid theme portal)

## System Architecture
The KILT Liquidity Incentive Portal is a full-stack TypeScript application emphasizing high performance, security, and scalability.

**Frontend Stack**:
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite.
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui (Radix UI), Tailwind CSS with custom KILT brand colors, glassmorphism dark theme.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query v5 (optimistic updates).
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **Web3**: Viem for type-safe Ethereum interactions on Base network.
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with deep link integration.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Cluely.com aesthetic, Inter font, minimal glassmorphism, dark theme, smooth transitions, micro-interactions, 6-tab interface (Overview, Add Liquidity, Positions, Rewards, Analytics, Integration), clear separation of trading fees and treasury rewards.

**Backend Stack**:
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript and ESM modules, Node.js runtime.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (Neon Database).
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with Zod validation, JSON responses.
- **Real-time Data**: CoinGecko API.
- **Performance**: Aggressive caching, parallel processing (e.g., ParallelPositionProcessor, ParallelDataLoader), request deduplication for sub-second responses.

**Database Schema (Core Entities)**:
- Users, LP Positions, Rewards, Pool Stats, Analytics Tables, Treasury Configuration (single source of truth for smart contract addresses).

**Smart Contract Architecture**:
- **Core Contract**: `BasicTreasuryPool` deployed to Base network for treasury-based reward distribution.
- **Contract Status**: DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL on Base network at `0x3ee2361272EaDc5ADc91418530722728E7DCe526`.
- **Treasury Balance**: 20,990 KILT currently deposited and available for reward distribution.
- **Token**: KILT (0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8) on Base network.
- **Security**: Funds held directly by contract, includes owner controls and transfer validations.
- **Reward System**: Immediate claiming available with owner-controlled reward distribution.
- **Admin Control**: Single owner model with emergency withdrawal capabilities.
- **Reward Formula**: Sophisticated formula for proportional reward distribution based on liquidity share, time, in-range multiplier, and full-range bonus.
- **Contract Verification**: Contract bytecode confirmed deployed, ABI updated to match BasicTreasuryPool functions.

**Core Functionality Specifications**:
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect (with deep link support).
- **Liquidity Management**: Full Uniswap V3 NFT position management (mint, increase, decrease, collect, burn) with UI for creation (sliders, presets, range visualization).
- **Reward System**: KILT treasury rewards with proportional distribution.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live KILT token data, pool metrics (TVL, volume, APR), user portfolio dashboards.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design, mobile-optimized tabs, deep link integration.
- **Position Tracking**: Complete LP position lifecycle management with historical analytics.
- **One-Click Features**: One-click liquidity addition and rebalancing.
- **Buy KILT Integration**: Seamless "Buy KILT" functionality through Uniswap swap interface.

**System Design Choices**:
- **Data Integrity**: 100% authentic blockchain data with zero fallbacks.
- **Database-Driven Configuration**: Smart contract addresses stored in database as single source of truth, eliminating hardcoded values throughout the application.
- **Performance**: Aggressive caching, parallel processing, optimized API responses.
- **Modularity**: Clean component architecture.
- **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, secure smart contract design.
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation, clear messaging, visually appealing glassmorphism dark theme.
