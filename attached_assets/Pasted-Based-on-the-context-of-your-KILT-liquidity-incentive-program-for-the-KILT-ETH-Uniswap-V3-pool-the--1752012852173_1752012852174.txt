Based on the context of your KILT liquidity incentive program for the KILT/ETH Uniswap V3 pool, the goal is to attract users with a high APR while ensuring the 1% reward pool (2,905,600 KILT) lasts at least one year. The refined approach incorporating a bonding curve to handle increasing user numbers (due to the open nature of Uniswap) provides the best balance. Hereâ€™s the selected design:

### Best Design
- **Max Total Supply**: 290,560,000 KILT.
- **Reward Pool**: 1% of total supply = 2,905,600 KILT.
- **Duration**: 365 days.
- **Daily Budget**: \( 2,905,600 / 365 \approx 7,960 \) KILT.

#### Reward Formula
- \( R_u = (w_1 \cdot \frac{L_u}{T} + w_2 \cdot \frac{D_u}{365}) \cdot \frac{R}{365} \cdot \frac{k}{N + k} \)
  - \( w_1 = 0.6 \) (weight for liquidity provided).
  - \( w_2 = 0.4 \) (weight for days active).
  - \( L_u \): Liquidity provided by user \( u \).
  - \( T \): Total liquidity in the pool.
  - \( D_u \): Days user \( u \) remains active (max 365).
  - \( R = 2,905,600 \) KILT.
  - \( N \): Number of active users.
  - \( k = 50 \) (bonding curve constant, adjustable).

#### Example
- \( N = 100 \), \( L_u = 5\% \) of \( T \), \( D_u = 180 \) days:
  - \( \frac{L_u}{T} = 0.05 \), \( \frac{D_u}{365} \approx 0.493 \).
  - Base component = \( 0.6 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.493 \approx 0.2272 \).
  - Daily reward = \( 0.2272 \cdot 7,960 \cdot \frac{50}{100 + 50} \approx 0.2272 \cdot 7,960 \cdot 0.333 \approx 602.91 \cdot 0.333 \approx 200.87 \) KILT/day (error in prior calc; corrected base adjustment).
  - Correction: \( \frac{R}{365 \cdot N} = \frac{7,960}{100} = 79.60 \) KILT/user/day, then \( R_u = 0.2272 \cdot 79.60 \cdot 0.333 \approx 18.09 \cdot 0.333 \approx 6.03 \) KILT/day.
  - Annual reward = \( 6.03 \times 365 \approx 2,201 \) KILT.
  - If \( L_u \) value = $10,000, APR = \( \frac{2,201}{10,000} \times 100 \approx 22\% \).

#### Why This is Best
1. **High Initial APR**: At \( N = 100 \), APR ~22% is attractive, drawing users early.
2. **Sustainability**: The bonding curve (\( \frac{k}{N + k} \)) reduces rewards as \( N \) grows (e.g., at \( N = 500 \), \( \frac{50}{550} \approx 0.091 \), APR drops to ~4-5%), ensuring the 2,905,600 KILT lasts 365 days.
3. **Fairness**: Rewards scale with \( L_u \) and \( D_u \), rewarding both contribution and commitment.
4. **Adaptability**: Adjustable \( k \) and weights (\( w_1, w_2 \)) allow fine-tuning based on pool activity.

#### Handling Increased Users
- **Bonding Curve Effect**: As \( N \) increases, \( f(N) \) decays, preventing reward dilution beyond the budget.
- **Liquidity Cap**: Introduce a cap on \( T \) (e.g., 10% of pool liquidity earns full rewards) to focus incentives.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: If APR falls below 15%, increase \( k \) (e.g., to 100) to boost early rewards.

### Implementation
- Use a smart contract to track \( L_u \), \( D_u \), \( N \), and \( T \), applying the bonding curve.
- Monitor weekly and adjust \( k \) to maintain target APR (e.g., 20-25% initially).

This design optimizes user attraction and reward longevity. Would you like a canvas panel to visualize APR vs. \( N \) with this formula?
